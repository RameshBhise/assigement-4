    "Que 1  class: a class describes the contents of the objects that belong to it: \n",
    "        it describes an aggregate of data fields (called instance variables), and defines the operations (called methods).\n",
    "        object: an object is an element (or instance) of a class; objects have the behaviors of their class.\n",
    "Que 2  These principles are called the four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP). \n",
    "      These four pillars are Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Abstraction.\n",
    "Que 3 The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "     To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in _init_() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "      All classes have a function called _init_(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.\n",

    "Que 4  The self variable is used to represent the instance of the class which is often used in object-oriented programming. \n",
    "       It works as a reference to the object. Python uses the self parameter to refer to instance attributes and methods of the \n",
    "Que 5  inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the property of another class. \n",
    "       For example, a child inherits the traits of his/her parents. With inheritance, we can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class. \n",
    "       Hence, inheritance facilitates Reusability and is an important concept of OOPs."
